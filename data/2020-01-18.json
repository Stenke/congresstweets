But Kershaw is a great pitcher - and in 2017, the fact is, he was lights out in the (away) 12? innings he pitched, and lost a tough one 2-1, and was scoreless in clutch after Yu blew up.  Just observing. https://twitter.com/perkinsrrp/status/1218720002666307584 QT @PerkinsRRP @chiproytx @ClaytonKersh22 @Dodgers @astros .@ClaytonKersh22 gave up the 2 tying runs in game 7 of the 2019 NLCS in less than 1/3 of an inning that allowed the Nats to win.
